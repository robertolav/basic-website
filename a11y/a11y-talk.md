Perfect—this is a smart, achievable focus. We’ll frame the storytelling and problem statement around clarity and empowerment, not fixing national login systems. Here’s how we can make it compelling:

Narrative Framework for Your Audience
Hook (Relatable Scenario)
"Imagine you’re building a service that looks great and meets deadlines. But when a user with a screen reader tries to complete a key task, they hit a barrier. You didn’t know it was there—because no one checked the full journey. That’s the risk of flying blind."

Problem Statement
“Accessibility is a team sport—but without clarity, we can’t play it well.”
Right now, most teams don’t know:
  • Where accessibility stands in their project and connected ecosystem.
  • Which components are strong and which are weak.
  • How to measure improvement at the end.
Without this baseline, accessibility remains guesswork, and we miss the chance to show quantifiable progress.

Solution Statement
Run an Accessibility-First Audit.
  • Purpose: Get clarity on the baseline position across your service and its dependencies.
  • Outcome:
    ○ Identify strengths and weaknesses early.
    ○ Build a prioritized improvement plan.
    ○ Capture metrics (e.g., % WCAG AA compliance, task success rates) to demonstrate impact at project close.
"Clarity is power. An audit turns accessibility from an abstract ideal into actionable insight."

Storytelling Angle
  • Frame the audit as the first chapter of the hero’s journey:
“Every great transformation starts with knowing where you stand. The audit is our map—it shows the terrain, the obstacles, and the quickest route to success.”
  • Use before/after contrast:
Before: We assume accessibility is fine → hidden barriers cause user frustration.
After: We know exactly where we stand → we fix issues and celebrate measurable wins.

Call to Action
"Let’s make clarity our superpower. Commit to an A11y-first audit—because what gets measured gets improved."

✅ Next step: I can draft a storytelling-driven presentation deck with:
  • Title: “Clarity First: Why an Accessibility Audit Changes Everything”
  • Slides: Hook → Problem → Solution → Benefits → How to Start → Call to Action
  • Embedded narrative, visuals (journey map, audit checklist), and metrics placeholders.
Or, if you prefer, I can write a short script for you to deliver live (with talking points and emotional hooks).
Which do you want first:
  • A) A redesigned presentation deck with storytelling baked in
  • B) A written script for a live talk?
