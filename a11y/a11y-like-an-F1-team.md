What If We Treated Accessibility Like McLaren Treats Performance?
A Thought Experiment + Lessons Learned + Action Steps
Imagine if our delivery teams operated like McLaren Racing—not in speed, but in mindset.
Before every race, they baseline everything: car setup, telemetry, team roles. They define success in milliseconds, create urgency with countdowns, optimize relentlessly, and build a culture of learning.
What if we applied those principles to accessibility-first delivery?
I’m not claiming to have all the answers. I haven’t run a full accessibility audit yet across the wider . This is a retro exercise—a reflection on what I’ve learned so far and what I intend to do next time. Think of this as a thought experiment, not a finished playbook.

Lessons Learned
  • Accessibility is a team sport: Without shared ownership, progress stalls.
  • Dependencies matter: Even if your service is accessible, login/auth flows can break the journey.
  • Culture is the hardest part: Accessibility needs to be framed as value, not compliance.

Action Steps for Next Time
✅ Baseline: Run an A11y-first feasibility check; map stakeholders early.
✅ Define Success: Agree on 3–5 KPIs (e.g., % journeys passing WCAG AA, assistive tech task success); tie success to cost impact (think Purple Pound).
✅ Create Urgency: Time-box improvements; make progress visible.
✅ Optimize: Apply marginal gains—one improvement per sprint.
✅ Build Culture: Foster psychological safety; celebrate small wins; share learnings.

Closing Thought:
McLaren doesn’t win by accident—they win by clarity, data, and culture. We’re not racing at 200 mph, but the principle is the same: measure, learn, improve. My next project is where I’ll put this into practice. For now, this is my thought experiment—and maybe it sparks yours too.

Caveat: Comparing a high-performing F1 team to a slower, less efficient digital delivery team is aspirational, not prescriptive. The gap is huge. My next challenge? Find pragmatic teams just ahead on the accessibility journey, learn from them, and take action to close the gap.

What’s your experience? Have you tried an accessibility-first approach? What worked—and what didn’t?
