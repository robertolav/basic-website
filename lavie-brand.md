✅ Next Steps
Would you like me to:
  1. Create a full brand manifesto (vision, mission, values, personality, voice)?
  2. Design a visual identity concept (colors, fonts, logo ideas)?
  3. Draft a LinkedIn bio or About page for LaVie?
  4. Map out content themes for your areas of interest?
Which of these feels most urgent for you? Or should we start with the manifesto to give LaVie a strong foundation?
