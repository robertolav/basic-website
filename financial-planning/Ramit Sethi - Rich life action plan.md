✅ Step-by-Step Action Plan


Phase 1: Mindset & Vision

1. Stop apologizing for spending—practice saying “Thank you” when complimented.
2. Define your Rich Life:
- Write down your perfect Tuesday.
- Expand to a week, month, and 10-year vision.

Phase 2: Financial Baseline

3. Calculate Net Worth:

- List assets, investments, savings, and debts.
- Compute: Assets + Investments + Savings – Debt.

Phase 3: Build Your Conscious Spending Plan

4. Determine Take-Home Pay (monthly after tax). 5. Allocate into four buckets:

- Fixed Costs: 50–60%
- Savings: 5–10%
- Investments: 5–10%
- Guilt-Free Spending: 20–35%.

Phase 4: Identify Money Dials

6. List what you love spending on (food, travel, fitness, etc.).

7. Rank them and pick your top dial.

8. Decide what to cut back on to fund your top dial.

Phase 5: Automate Your System

9. Connect accounts: Checking → Savings → Investments.

10. Set up automatic transfers:

- Fixed costs via credit card (paid in full monthly).

- Savings and investments auto-transfer after payday.

11. Leave guilt-free spending in checking for discretionary use.

Phase 6: Review & Optimize

12. Spend 1 hour/month reviewing your plan.

13. Adjust percentages as income or priorities change.
