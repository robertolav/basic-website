Create a finance dashboard

I want a google sheet that I can input the following information separately for me and my wife based on the following:

Step 1: Define What You Want to See
Your dashboard should give you and Mary a clear snapshot of your financial position. Key sections could include:

Investments
  • Pension
  • ISA
  • Crypto
  • Shares
  
Savings goals
  • Emergency fund

Debt Overview
  • Mortgage
  • Car loan

Net worth
  • Assets (House): £550,000
  • Investments (Pension): £30,000
  • Savings & Investments: £10,000
  • Total Debt (Mortgage + Other): £173,000

Conscious spending plan
  • Income
  • Fixed costs
  • Investments
  • Savings goals
  • Guilt free spending

  
Step 2: Structure Your Dashboard
Here’s a suggested layout:
Top Section:
  • Total Net Worth
  • Total Income vs Expenses
  • Savings Rate (%)
Middle Section:
  • Pie chart of spending categories
  • Progress bars for goals
Bottom Section:
  • Upcoming bills
  • Investment performance
