From Simon Sinek's perspective, your "WHY" is the core belief or purpose that drives everything you do. Based on your performance achievement and motivations, your "WHY" could be summarized as follows:

"To empower individuals and teams to grow, succeed, and deliver meaningful impact by building frameworks, fostering collaboration, and solving complex challenges, so that organizations and people can achieve their fullest potential."

Breakdown of Your WHY:
  1. Empowering Others:
You are deeply motivated by equipping others—be it through training pathways, onboarding resources, or mentoring—to succeed and grow in their careers.
  2. Creating Frameworks for Growth:
Your focus on establishing structured processes, career development frameworks, and efficient workflows reflects a belief in building systems that enable sustainable progress.
  3. Driving Meaningful Impact:
Delivering impactful outcomes, such as saving costs or transitioning critical systems, showcases your commitment to making a tangible difference.
  4. Fostering Collaboration:
Navigating difficult conversations, leading cross-functional teams, and sharing best practices emphasize your dedication to teamwork and shared success.
  5. Unlocking Potential:
By leading projects that contribute to personal and organizational growth, you align with a purpose of enabling others to reach their potential.
This WHY aligns with Simon Sinek’s idea of inspiring others to act and creating environments where people feel empowered, supported, and capable of achieving great things.
