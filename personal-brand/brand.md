Rob LaVie brand
Thank you for clarifying—that’s an important distinction. If LaVie is currently your personal brand vehicle, the manifesto should reflect that it’s about your journey and perspective, not a community (yet). Let’s reshape it so it feels authentic and focused on you as the creator.

LaVie Brand Manifesto (Personal Focus)
What LaVie Stands For
LaVie is my space to explore, learn, and share ideas that matter to me. It’s a creative playground where I experiment with thoughts on technology, learning, and human potential—always with curiosity and purpose.
My Purpose
To live life to the full by embracing curiosity, pushing boundaries, and sharing insights that spark thinking and growth. LaVie is how I express what I’m learning and what I believe in.
My Focus Areas
  • Neurodiversity: Advocating for inclusion and celebrating different ways of thinking.
  • The Art of Learning: Exploring how we learn best and how to make learning joyful.
  • Technology & AI: Using tech as an enabler for accessibility and human progress.
  • Building Highly Effective Teams: Sharing principles that create trust, collaboration, and impact.
My Values
  • Curiosity: Always asking, always learning.
  • Authenticity: Sharing real experiences and insights.
  • Experimentation: Trying new ideas without fear.
  • Inclusivity: Respecting every perspective.
  • Impact: Creating content that helps others think differently.
My Vision
To create content that inspires reflection, sparks conversation, and helps people see possibilities—while I continue to learn and grow.

This version positions LaVie as your personal thought leadership platform, not a community yet.
✅ Next steps I can help with:
  1. Create a short, punchy tagline and bio for your LinkedIn profile (aligned with LaVie).
  2. Design a visual identity concept (logo, color palette, typography).
  3. Map out your first 10 content ideas across your four focus areas.
  4. Draft a one-liner mission statement for LaVie for your posts.
