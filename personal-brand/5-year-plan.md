I see myself leveraging & riding the wave of AI

As a senior deliver lead, leading and training a team of delivery managers and delivery teams. - I'm already providing career coaching and creating content for learning skills.

I'm pushing the boundaries of test AI

Some of the challenges I will have solved are automating processes as quickly as possible.

I have a process to document processes, & I've had success at automating those processes.

I expect to further develop that process to manage more complex processes that are interrelated, that have triggers for finish to start processes.

My immediate goal now is to be established as a expert in personal communication. I'm using AI to get feedback on things like active listening. I'm already using this skill to present myself better in leadership meetings & have more of an impact.

I provide a career development audit for people

I deliver sessions to support people studying for the PMP exam.

I'm an inclusion & diversity advocate. I'm particularly interested in closing the gap that is present for anyone paying the 'disability tax'. I am energised and enthused when people who feel at a disadvantage are given support and opportunities to overcome those limitations. AI is a huge enabler for closing that gap and demonstrating ability, creativity & innovation.
