Hey Rob - great to chat. Have been thinking about what you said about wanting better conversations with your directors - to get a clearer read on what’s happening across Accenture and government, show up as really helpful to your managers, and quietly put yourself on the map for future work. As I said, there’s a framework I use that could work brilliantly for that. It’s built for consulting sales, but it’s actually great for strategic listening and positioning conversations. You can use it to turn a catch-up into something much more useful - for them and for you. Here’s a simple version you could try: 


Build rapport Start human and curious: 
• What’s been most energising or frustrating in your world lately? 
• What’s keeping you busiest right now? 
• What are you noticing across government or clients? 


 Set the frame 
• “Would be great to use this to get a sense of where things are at, where they’re heading, and how I can best add value.” 
• Quick, confident framing shows you’re proactive and strategic. 


 Explore the current state 
• What are the big priorities or pressures in your area? 
• Where’s the real demand or momentum across government work? 
• What’s working really well — and what’s proving harder? 


 Look ahead (next 9–12 months) 
• What’s on the horizon for your portfolio or for Accenture more widely? 
• Where do you see the biggest growth or risk areas? 
• What would success look like a year from now? 


 Dig into challenges 
• What’s the hardest nut to crack right now? 
• What’s getting in the way of that next step or opportunity? 
• Where do you wish we had more capacity, capability or insight? 


 Why now 
• Why is this moment critical - what’s shifting in the market or with clients? 


 Add value 
• “That’s really interesting - I’ve seen similar things in [X area]. Would it be useful if I shared a quick summary or connected you to someone working on that?” → Helps you show up as resourceful, not self-promotional. 


 Close and follow up 
• “Sounds like there’s a lot happening - mind if I check in again next month as things develop?” 

Keep notes - patterns will emerge about priorities and personalities. It’s basically a structure for learning fast, showing curiosity, and I pray leaving people thinking ‘Rob gets it and adds value.’
