I'm super inspired by this interview. I immediately start to compare this mindset, volume of data points, success measures, the ultimate in highly effective team. Compared to F1 the teams I've worked on a probably average or worse. How can I take these lesson learnt and apply it to managing a delivery team.

Create a baseline, where are we currently at, what are our strengths & weaknesses, what is the culture & environment we operate in.
How to generate urgency?
What does success look like? 
How do we optimise and improve?

I love the way you’re thinking about this—taking lessons from a high-performance environment like F1 and applying them to software delivery is a powerful mindset shift. Let’s build a structured roadmap inspired by McLaren’s approach, tailored for your context as a Technology Delivery Lead.

✅ Step 1: Establish a Baseline
Before you can optimize, you need clarity on where you stand.
Questions to answer:
  • What is our current delivery velocity and predictability?
  • How often do we hit deadlines vs. miss them?
  • What is the quality of our output (defects, rework)?
  • How strong is collaboration and psychological safety?
  • What tools and processes are in place for visibility and integration?
Actions:
  • Run a team health check survey (covering morale, clarity, autonomy, and alignment).
  • Collect delivery metrics: lead time, cycle time, defect rates, deployment frequency.
  • Map current workflows and identify bottlenecks.

✅ Step 2: Define Success
McLaren’s success metric is milliseconds. What’s yours?
Questions to answer:
  • What does “winning” look like for this team? Faster releases? Higher quality? Happier stakeholders?
  • How do we measure incremental gains?
Actions:
  • Agree on 3–5 key performance indicators (KPIs) (e.g., lead time, defect escape rate, team engagement score).
  • Create a visual dashboard for transparency.
  • Adopt the mindset: “Win or Learn”—every sprint is either a success or a learning opportunity.

✅ Step 3: Generate Urgency
F1 thrives on urgency because the race clock never stops. You need a similar energy.
Ideas:
  • Time-box experiments: e.g., “Let’s improve deployment frequency by 20% in 6 weeks.”
  • Share impact stories: how delays affect customers or revenue.
  • Use visible countdowns for major milestones (like McLaren’s race calendar).

✅ Step 4: Optimize & Improve
Borrow McLaren’s principles:
  • Marginal Gains: Identify small, high-impact improvements each sprint.
  • Simulation & Data: Use metrics to predict bottlenecks and test changes.
  • Integration: Reduce silos—connect tools (Jira, CI/CD, monitoring) for end-to-end visibility.
Actions:
  • Implement retrospective-driven experiments (one improvement per sprint).
  • Automate repetitive tasks (CI/CD pipelines, test automation).
  • Introduce predictive dashboards (e.g., forecast delivery risk based on current velocity).

✅ Step 5: Build Culture
Culture is McLaren’s secret weapon. For your team:
  • Encourage bravery in prioritization: cut work that doesn’t add value.
  • Foster psychological safety: mistakes = learning, not blame.
  • Promote continuous learning: share insights from each sprint like McLaren’s post-race analysis.

Lessons from McLaren Applied to Software Delivery
F1 Principle	Software Equivalent
Performance-led mindset	Every feature must add measurable business value
Millions of simulations	Automated tests, staging environments, chaos engineering
Marginal gains	Continuous improvement via retrospectives
Data-driven decisions	Delivery metrics, predictive analytics
Win or Learn	Fail fast, learn faster

Roadmap Summary
  1. Baseline: Assess current state (metrics + culture).
  2. Define Success: Set clear KPIs and a “win” metric.
  3. Create Urgency: Time-box goals, make impact visible.
  4. Optimize: Apply marginal gains, automate, integrate.
  5. Culture: Build psychological safety and learning loops.

Timestamp 07:00-28:00

Daniel Keyworth - Director, Business Technology at McLaren Racing

Here’s the conversation reorganized into Questions and Detailed Answers for clarity and depth:

1. What technologies is McLaren considering for the future, especially with the 2026 regulation changes?
Answer:
McLaren is preparing for a major regulation cycle in 2026, which will bring changes to car design and power units. This requires rethinking simulation models, pre-race strategies, and in-race decision-making systems. AI is central to this future strategy, alongside traditional machine learning techniques that have been used for over a decade. The team is exploring large language models (LLMs) for productivity and accessibility, enabling engineers to query complex datasets in natural language. The guiding principle: any technology adopted must deliver measurable performance gains—milliseconds matter in Formula One.
2. How much data do you collect during a race, and how is it used in real time?
Answer:
Each car has 150,000 sensors, generating hundreds of thousands of telemetry parameters in real time. Across a race weekend, this equates to 250 million data points per car, or 1.5 terabytes of data. Engineers track this data both at the track and remotely at Mission Control in Woking. Proprietary software surfaces insights to help make critical decisions—such as tire changes and pit stop timing—without overwhelming the team. The goal is to separate signal from noise, ensuring engineers can act on the most relevant insights quickly.
3. How does McLaren use AI for performance optimization and decision support?
Answer:
AI is deployed across the entire lifecycle of the car—from factory workflows to race-day strategy. Key applications include:
  • Anomaly detection in vast telemetry streams.
  • Simulation optimization, running millions of permutations before race weekends.
  • Decision support during races, predicting outcomes of strategic choices. LLMs are being explored to make traditional models more accessible, reducing the barrier to entry for engineers by enabling natural language queries. This democratizes data access and accelerates decision-making.
  
4. How do you make data accessible across the organization for agility?
Answer:
McLaren emphasizes a foundational data strategy:
  • Clear governance for structured and unstructured data.
  • Infrastructure that supports rapid compute for model training and inference.
  • Integration across software platforms to ensure seamless data flow. The vision is data democratization—any team member can access insights quickly, often through natural language interfaces powered by AI. This reduces latency between data collection and actionable decisions.

5. How do you balance innovation speed with reliability and precision in system integration projects?
Answer:
McLaren follows a problem-led approach rather than chasing shiny technologies. Every system must meet two criteria:
  • Performance impact: measurable contribution to lap time or reliability.
  • 100% reliability: no tolerance for failure on race day. By focusing on solving real problems, McLaren avoids fragmented systems and integration headaches. Cultural principles reinforce this: ruthlessly prioritize projects that add performance and eliminate those that don’t.

6. What cultural and leadership principles guide experimentation vs. precision?
Answer:
Culture is described as “everything” at McLaren. Key principles include:
  • Marginal gains mindset: small, incremental improvements compound into significant advantages.
  • Leave it better than you found it: every project should improve the Technology Centre.
  • Win or Learn: reframing failure as learning accelerates progress without fear. This culture encourages bravery in decision-making while maintaining relentless focus on performance.

7. How can other organizations emulate McLaren’s “learn fast, adapt faster” mindset?
Answer:
Organizations should:
  • Define their “win” metric (e.g., quarterly earnings, customer satisfaction).
  • Align all initiatives to that metric—if it doesn’t ladder up, cut it.
  • Adopt “win or learn” thinking to avoid paralysis by fear of failure.
  • Focus on incremental progress rather than waiting for big-bang transformations. This approach ensures agility without sacrificing reliability.

8. What excites McLaren about the next wave of technology in motorsport and beyond?
Answer:
Upcoming regulation changes and emerging technologies create a dynamic future. Key areas of excitement:
  • AI and process automation: freeing humans from repetitive tasks to focus on high-value work.
  • Robotics and AGI: potential long-term disruptors.
  • Unpredictable innovation curve: unlike five years ago, tomorrow’s tech landscape is harder to forecast, which keeps the team energized. The overarching goal remains the same: leverage technology to unlock performance and win championships.

9. What is one takeaway for technology leaders about where things are headed?
Answer:
Technology now has a clear seat at the boardroom table—modern CEOs may increasingly come from CTO backgrounds. Leaders should:
  • Look beyond their industry for inspiration.
  • Build strong networks of technologists to share insights.
  • Stay grounded in fundamentals while exploring emerging tech. The pace of change is accelerating, but opportunities for impact have never been greater.

team over the last eight years here to deliver a very ambitious technology strategy to give the team the capabilities that they need to compete at the sharp end of Formula One, which is a relentless sport. And as you see, you know, we're two times world champions now. That's been an incredible journey. journey back to the front. And what's great is there's so much more opportunity ahead in particular as we go into a new regulation cycle in 2026. You know what? That's fascinating. As you go into that, how many technologies are you thinking of you know, for, you know, migrating into the future. We got it. I think there's no escaping AI and what that's, you know, incredibly capable of.
If you look at Formula One, it's actually grounded in, you know, at least a decade in traditional machine learning. And the technology leaders I speak to all the time going, you know, how do we embrace some of the more traditional techniques, but of course things like large language models and agendas and AI is really sort of driving the boom as it is. And of course there's a lot of valuable opportunity in those types of technologies as well. So, you know, we're always keeping a watching brief. whatever we deploy has a tangible impact ultimately to performance. You know, we're a performance led organization. Everything we have to do has to bring time and milliseconds to the car. So we judge ourselves quite quickly as to how we adopt technology. Equally, in reg change cycle, you know, the car's changed slightly. So we've got to be on our toes about how we adapt to that.
But equally, the power units change in 2026. So the way that we simulate and kind of pre-game simulation as well as game simulation in the race, all of that needs to be questioned and changed as well. that you just won't know until we go testing first thing in the new year. So a lot of it's around good preparation and then making sure that we can react really quickly when we hit the tarmac next year. Man, reacting quickly is everything in racing, isn't it? So 41, I think it's often described as a sport, I think driven by data as much as it is by engineering. How much data do you collect during a race and then how do you use that data to maybe in real time to influence the performance within that race? Yeah, it's a huge amount of data. We have 150,000. sensors on the Formula One car that's generating hundreds of thousands of parameters of telemetry in real time.
It's our job to kind of process that information, surface it to our engineers that are in the garage, and also use our own proprietary software to give them more unique insights to the McLaren base than might help us make those decisions as well. Luckily, we have a team of 30 also back in Mission Control in Woking just outside of London that are looking at this data as well in real time and providing their own insight from a distance. And actually it's a much easier place to kind of digest information, look at all the different scenarios and help the team that attract side, you know, give the drivers the best possible information and make sure we're making the right decisions, whether that's about how we're setting the car up. This could be happening through the free practice sessions when you get those opportunities through to the kind of in-race decisions like when's the best time. to make a pit stop, what compound tire do you want to change to? So yeah, all of that is data driven. We have 250 million data points per race car per weekend, and that's way north of one and a half terabytes of information that we've got to do really meaningful things I think we've got to make sure that our engineers and our team aren't drowning in data. We want to make sure they're kind of comfortably swimming in it so they can see all of those insights. They have all those precision decisions. But I still think we can drive them.
Yeah, I talk a lot about. separating the signal from the noise. And it sounds like there is a ton of signal when it comes to these cars. That's really amazing. After the race weekend, right? You've got all this data that you collected maybe through the practice cycles, maybe in the race itself. How does your team then, you know, and then we use that data and simulation to kind of improve your cycles of design, testing, development, adding towards the next race. Yeah, exactly. You know, this is a continual cycle of development that's happening. It's interesting.
If you win the first race in Formula One, you do nothing to your car. The likelihood is you're going to come last. So the rapid innovation of how many changes we're making to the car, whether that's race by race or whether those are planned upgrades throughout the season. We go through something called CFD, Computational Fluid Dynamics. That is a full digital twin of our Formula One car that allows us to aerate. dynamically simulate all the different conditions that we think will give us more downforce. That's kind of the economy that we trade in. And then we put that in a physical wind tunnel as well. So we get our first correlation of the physical world and we create a 16% version model of the Formula One car, which looks like the most interesting toy car that you've ever seen. And then, of course, we have the driver simulator, and then we're collecting all that information from the track as well to call these reference points through the design lifecycle that then are being put through its bases and in reality at the track.
So it's our role to start crunching that information information and go, have we recognized the reforms we expected? That's question number one. And the second thing, where is there more opportunity for improvement? So as soon as the car hits the track, all that's doing is like you say, feeds the loop again and goes back to the top of the cycle and ultimately informs the next wave of development. That's awesome. You mentioned a few minutes ago the technology strategy that you're implementing at McLaren Racing. What are the biggest priorities that are shaping your strategy and how do you ensure that the technological priorities within that, you know, to support your performance on the track. Yeah, I think, you know, data is, as I say, like, data is a big part of our lives. We want to do is make sure our data is set up in a way that we can, you know, we can leverage more machine learning, more simulation, more artificial intelligence to give us a performance edge. And actually, as technology evolves, the way you manage and the way you treat data has to evolve, as well.
So we tend not to stand still. If you stand still, you're going backwards. That's a typical phrase we use. So that's a, that's a really key focus area for us. And again, in that simulation space, you know, we're running millions of simulations ahead of a race weekend to get the car set up. But actually, we're learning more and more about the types of tracks and this style of car as well, which is a ground effect aerodynamically So there's more information that we can now start to, yeah, really take control of and go, how do we make better decisions? In such a short space of time, you only get an hour in the practice sessions, which is far less than it used to be. So after that hour, you've got to make a quick decision of what's our next run plan or what, whatever that might be. And then the final thing is systems integration. I think it talks a lot of technology leaders about kind of, you know, isolated systems and how, you know, businesses have run like that through the course of time.
And actually the greater systems integration that you can achieve, the information flow is from the start of concept and idea through to the reality. And that's not in Formula One, that's in any industry. If you're selling a product, it had to go through an idea and a concept, it had to go through R&D and then it had to be delivered, it had to be a real product. So these things. resonate in Formula One as well. So systems integration as a whole is always a key focus for us to make sure that we have the team ultimately completely plugged in to everything that they do here inside the cloud. It's interesting that you mentioned the systems integration piece. with I think a lot of organizations have these system integration projects, you know, longitudinal projects that come with our own difficulties. At McLaren Racing, how do you engage with those systems implementation or integration projects? Well, kind of balance balancing the need for innovation in those projects and the ability to move quickly, but balancing that with the reliability and precision that you need on race day.
Yeah, of course. You know, we live by some principles. We want to make sure that everything is, has a performance-led mindset against it, has to deliver. 100% reliability. We don't ever want to see the car stop on track. And these are all questions we ask as we go through that sort of evaluation phase of any kind of system that we implement. And also, we like to be problem-led. We want to really say, you know, what's the thing we're actually trying to solve? It's very, easy to get excited by a product and go, oh, we're just going to buy it and then we'll figure it out. Like that's not our mindset.
We really, you know, we really lean into the problem and go, how do we genuinely solve this through a good technology answer? And organically, then you don't end up with systems integration issues because it's been well thought about. So that's a, that's, Yeah, so that's a learning curve we've been on over time. And I think other technology leaders equally would have been on that. But we feel like we're in a really mature and great space in terms of that topic. That's awesome. It sounds like you approach these system implementation integration challenges right the technology challenges almost as a as a culture or leadership challenge right where you really have to think through what the problem is and what the you know what your approach to the solution is going to be can you talk a little bit more just about what the what the culture leadership looks like at McLaren racing with respect to that balance between between experimentation and precision yeah you know look culture's everything to us you know it gives us the energy that we need in order to move the dial all the time like you have to always be making a step forward there's you know the concepts of marginal gains, which is small incremental gains add up to something far more significant. And that's an approach we follow. One of the things I like to say is we've got to find the Macquarie Technology Centre, which is our home. You've got to leave it better than you found it.
That's always a good mindset to have because you go, well, actually, all of these projects that we've been running over the course of time, like, are they relevant? Are they relevant to performance? You know, we need to be more ruthless in here's the priority. This one doesn't add up to performance. So actually it comes off the list. Like these are the things that we encourage our team to be brave around. rather than just following the daily trend and just being like, oh, it'll figure itself out that we are mega focused all the time. And I think that's what happens in a high sporting environment that you can see the effect of the things that you're doing every week because the results speak for themselves on track. Everyone's got to be dialed in similar to the cars. And yeah, like it's always good to see the fruits of your labor.
Speak nobody in the hand. My question for you. I think most technology leaders at this point are feeling the speed that you're talking about. The last couple of years as generative AI has continued to evolve. Things feel like they're just getting faster and faster, right? The speed at which organizations are transforming is increasing. How is McLaren using AI to stay competitive? Are you using it for performance? optimization for predictive analytics for decision support. What examples can you share with us around around the implementation of AI inside of McLaren racing?
Yeah, I think the range is broad. You know, like you said earlier, AI is very good at things like anomaly detection. So it's a huge amount of information that we are able to consume. tune and actually getting focused on the right data points and being able to clear clear our minds of the things that we don't want to be focused on is a is a big part in which ai plays um and these models are deployed at all parts of the cycle of a formal one car so this isn't just at the sharp end of racing where we know we're stimulating all the different permutations and what might be happening in the race and therefore what decisions we might be making. This goes all the way back to, you know, how is the car flowing through the factory? How are we making decisions as a team based on the data that we're seeing? So, you know, that's how it kind of has happened and evolved over time. I think what's quite exciting about things like large language models, like pure productivity, there's a gain to be had, particularly as you feed it your own proprietary information and you can give it context around not only Formula One, but then the team as well and the information that we hold. and also the ability for large language models to be an entry point into traditional models. I think this is an area that super excites me that I can now ask a natural language question of probably something that, you know, a model that's existed for the last five years and the barrier of entry into that data is far lower than it once was.
I think if we can unlock that and unleash that across our team and continue to do that, then actually they've got information at their fingertips faster than they ever have in the history of the plan. So super exciting space. Obviously won't share everything that we're up to because that is our secret weapon to some degree. But yeah, it's an area where we're always dialed into, but we also don't lose focus on other topics as well. It's one that's gaining pace, but we are, you know, we're conscious that technology spans far more different topics out there today. Yeah, I think that what you mentioned about the the accessibility of data, right? The mitigating the cost of entry into these traditional models that you've had is a huge PowerPoint for AI, ensuring the right people will get the right insights, the right data at the right time, whether that's during a race or during simulations afterwards whenever it is. Can you talk to us a little bit more about how McLaren Racing enables that data-driven agility, that ability for all of your organization to have data accessible at their fingertips as they need it? Well, some of this is foundational. right, you know, having a good infrastructure strategy, having a really clear data strategy with that structured or unstructured data, you know, where does it live, how is it accessible, how do you deploy it to compute if you're doing things like training models and you're delivering inference, all of that really matters.
So lots of people end up, you know, focus on the sort of the last mile as I would call it which is how do you execute actually having all that foundational stuff in place that people can access it across our entire software platforms and that they can easily like said you know through natural language and others they can get to that information super quickly because open and accessible to the entire team. Like that's a path we will continue to follow. Yeah, this sort of democratization of data, right, is has been a promise, I think, of technology for a long time, I think we're starting to live the actualization of that. And that's a very exciting time to be in the AI space and in the data space in general. I feel like we've had kind of two separate conversations going on for the past 20 minutes or so. We've had one around racing innovation and rights. racing do with the car on the track, all the sensors. What about enterprise innovation? How do we build the business systems that support everything behind the scenes? How can companies, how can technology leaders emulate the mindset that McLaren Racing has taken with, you know, learn fast, adapt faster in this age of kind of constant and increasing rate of change?
Yeah, I think, like I said before around, we have this very obvious and sort of tangible outcome, which is you win, you lose, right? So, you know, we know, that we're always focused on. What I tend to say to other technology leaders is like, you know, what is your win? You know, your result might be a quarterly earnings report or something that, you know, is your signal of success. But actually, if you can get really focused in on what the win is and everything else, you'll start to see either ladders up to it or it doesn't. that actually helps you get really clear on what the path is and what strategy is. And the other thing around, you know, failing fast is certainly a concept, but if you focus too much on failure, you can live in a state of failure. So we tend to say you either win or you learn. And that's always a great thing that we do every race weekend. So, you know, We're either one, two, and we're on the podium, and we've taken over the grand prize, or there are a huge amount of learning points for us to take onto the next race.
And we'll still obviously have learning points, even if we deliver well on track. So it's this constant evolution of, where is their opportunity? And to me, all of those sort of small and incremental changes really do move the dial. And they can't be underestimated as well. So if people are sitting there with these big programs in front of them and waiting for that big step change to come, actually you've got to eat the elephant in small chunks. And the only way to do that is to kind of live through the process the business and go where are there all these learning opportunities for us to yeah put our arms around and ultimately deliver quick and reliable solutions to I like that that terminology that phrasing that you had right where you either win or you learn and what's a really positive spin on the ability for an organization to, you know, to uplift themselves even when things don't go, don't go to plan. So that's great. So looking ahead, what excites you kind of about the next few years in motorsport? the next wave of technology beyond where we are today. And how do you think that those technologies have lessons for other businesses that might be navigating the various disruptive cycles that we're going through?
Yeah, well, look, we're going through another, with a reg cycle change, one before 2022 was 14 years. So we had to kind of adapt and everybody's always trying to adapt. But now it's been another four years, we're going to have to adapt again. So that alone for us is super exciting because we've got to make sure that our technology is for the purpose and that we're trying to solve, you know, all of these new problems. making sure we're super prepared for it as well. You know, others will be going through that and industry with regulation change, et cetera. So yeah, we're not alone, nor are others. I think we're on this just incredible kind of new wave tech, something that's they're going to keep me around the industry and keep me excited. I almost sort of don't know what tomorrow always looks like, which is perhaps different to the five years ago when it kind of became predictable about what the curve looked like. So that's exciting, which means we'll keep a watching brief on what the next wave of innovations AI certainly not going anywhere.
You know, process automation is gonna be at the forefront of a lot of people's minds. Like how do we take away the laborious out of people's lives so we can free them up to be the better versions of themselves and deliver true value to their businesses and our, you know, in our world that's, to the performance of a Formula One car. And then of course things like robotics and the topic of AGI. Like I think those things will just be, you know, continually discussed about when those points start to become the next wave. So yeah, super exciting time. Obviously we're always excited to make sure we embrace technology, but equally keep ourselves balanced on making sure that we are doing what we need to do to unlock performance to our race car and continue to go and win world championships. Balance is everything, right? You got four wheels for a reason. So as we start to wrap up. there any what's what's one you know one takeaway for technology leaders from this conversation what how would you how would you kind of position where things are today maybe where they're going over the next couple of months couple of years and what advice would you have for Yeah, look, I think we're all living in a very super exciting space at the moment.
So it's interesting as a lot of CEOs today typically come from a CFO background and the kind of the modern CEO is probably going to be the CTO, which is exciting but equally probably quite daunting for me. because the board will look at the technology. That means there's a huge amount of opportunity. Technology has a very clear seat at the table. Something I certainly encourage people to look beyond their nest as well and go, I work in this industry, therefore I compare myself to competitors or I want to just look within. Actually, it's great to sort of lift yourself out and go, what are other industries doing that are very relevant to me? And you'll also realize you're not allowed to as great to build a network of technologists. The people that are attending this will be wanting to get more industry perspective And I think that is super healthy during this time because it keeps you very grounded in the topic and it means that you're missing out on possibly future innovative opportunities in this space. So yeah, exciting time and I hope you'll enjoy the journey. Well, learning about new industries is always awesome for me, especially when I get to learn about racing.
I mean, it's so exciting. It's such an exciting topic, such an exciting story. So Dan, thank you for taking us behind the scenes at McLaren Racing and really for kind of connecting what happens
