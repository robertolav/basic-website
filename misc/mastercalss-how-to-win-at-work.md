  • Managing up
  • The art of executive presence
  • Build your brand
  • Building useful networks
  • Break the rules
  • Holding on to power once you have it
  
Here’s a summary of the main principles from Jeffrey Pfeffer’s MasterClass “How to Win at Work”:

Core Idea
Hard work alone won’t get you promoted. Success depends on understanding and leveraging power dynamics, building influence, and positioning yourself strategically within your organization.[1]

Key Principles
  1. Map Your Path to Power
    ○ Identify who holds real influence in your organization.
    ○ Create a “power map” to understand relationships and decision-making flows.
    ○ Position yourself where promotions and opportunities actually happen.[2]
  2. Manage Up
    ○ Learn how to work effectively with your boss and senior leaders.
    ○ Anticipate their needs and make their job easier.
    ○ Align your goals with theirs to gain sponsorship.[1]
  3. Master Executive Presence
    ○ First impressions matter more than credentials.
    ○ Confidence is a behavior—act as if you belong until you do.
    ○ Control posture, tone, and wardrobe to project authority.[3]
  4. Build Your Brand
    ○ Decide what you want to be known for and communicate it consistently.
    ○ Use social media and networking to amplify your reputation.
    ○ Promote your achievements—don’t assume others will notice.[4]
  5. Network Strategically
    ○ Build relationships with influential and diverse people.
    ○ Flattery and visibility are underrated tools—use them wisely.
    ○ Stay connected even in remote work settings to remain indispensable.[3]
  6. Break the Rules (When It Makes Sense)
    ○ Rule-followers rarely reach the top.
    ○ Take bold moves like bypassing the chain of command if it solves problems.
    ○ Never apologize for taking initiative—own your decisions.[4]
  7. Hold On to Power
    ○ Once you gain influence, maintain it by continuing to deliver results.
    ○ Keep your network strong and your visibility high.
    ○ Adapt to changing dynamics—power is never static.[1]

Mindset Shifts
  • Stop trying to be liked; focus on being effective.
  • Confidence beats authenticity—sometimes you need to act the part.
Visibility is critical: remote workers must over-communicate their impact.[3]
